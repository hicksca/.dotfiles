MY DOTFILES
===========

Automating so system setup on my work machine.

Currently configured via homemanager:
[x] vim 
[x] bash
[x] git

---

ToDo:
[x] bootstrapping script - makefile âœ“
    (nix/home manager does some of this)
    [ ] need to handle gpg keys (ssh keys largely managed 
        by orbstack)

Notes:
  - dev system in a nix vm (in orbstack)
    (since boardcom takeover VMware fusion is annoying me)
